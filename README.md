## 🧠 Training & Evaluation in PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to **train and evaluate a neural network using PyTorch**, focusing on best practices for model training, evaluation mode, and performance measurement.

### 🔍 What’s Covered
- Neural network implementation using `nn.Module`
- Training loop with forward pass, loss, backpropagation, and optimizer step
- Switching between `model.train()` and `model.eval()`
- Evaluation using accuracy
- Binary classification on the Breast Cancer dataset

### 🏗️ Model Architecture
Input (30 features)
→ Hidden Layer (16 neurons, ReLU)
→ Output Layer (Sigmoid)


###  Tools Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn

### 🎯 Key Learning
Training teaches the model, but **evaluation ensures it generalizes** — both are essential for reliable deep learning systems.

### 🚀 Next Step
Using **PyTorch Dataset & DataLoader** for scalable and efficient training.
